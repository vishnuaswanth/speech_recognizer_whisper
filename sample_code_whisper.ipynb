            "Transcript:  The Kipling poem is one of my favorites since I was a boy at school. My father read it to me once and I think it to me as a little boy, summed up what a man should be. If you can keep your head when all about you are losing their ass and blaming it on you. If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you but make allowances for their doubting too. If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, or being lied about and don't deal in lies, or being hated don't give way, dating and yet don't look too good or look too wise. If you can dream and not make dreams your master, if you can think and not make thoughts your aim. If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two impostas, it's just the same. If you can hear the truth you spoken twisted by naves to make a trap for fools, or watch the things you gave your life for broken and stupid and build them up with worn out tools. If you can make one heap of all your winnings, and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss. And lose and start again the beginning. Never breathe the word in the match of loss. If you can force your heart and nerve and sin you, to serve your turn, long after they are done. And so hold on when there is nothing in you, except the will which says to them, hold on. If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, or walk with kings and all those who come in touch, if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, before men can't forgive but not too much. If you can fill the unforgiving minute with 40 seconds worth of distance run, yours is the earth and everything that's in you and which is more you'll be a man, Wysan.\n",

            "Transcript:  Exercise is that uses only the weight of your body as resistance are known as calistenics, and just as any other resistance training, the golden performant calistenics is to promote muscle growth in strength. Original from the Greek words calo, which means beauty, and stenos, which means strength, calistenics rose into prominence in the 19th century by the father of gymnastics, free week, Louis John, and fitting enough, there's nothing really that is a better embodiment of beauty and strength than gymnastics. As calistenics uses your body's weight as resistance, it's also known as body weight exercises, and the big question about body weight exercises is how effective it is for building muscle in strength, or if it's as effective as lifting weights. To understand this, we need to understand how muscles grow and get stronger. Muscular and strength adaptation occurs when a stimulus or resistance is applied to the corresponding muscle at a high enough intensity to invoke muscle overload. Simply put, the more weight you move with your muscles, the more your muscles adapt and become bigger and stronger. But it doesn't mean that any type of weight movement will work. Take jogging, for example, although it can be very taxing on the heart muscles and promote cardiac muscle growth, it will not promote much to skeletal muscle growth, not even in your legs. The problem here is that the stimulus is not strong enough to target all the legs muscle fibers. If you watched the muscle fibers video before, you understand that we have three different muscle fiber types, one of which is used for endurance, known as type 1, and the other two are used to provide great amounts of force known as type 2 fibers. Since running doesn't require large amounts of force from your legs, type 2 fibers are hardly fatigue and not a lot of muscle growth occurs. It's also the reason why many do not consider jogging as a calistening exercise, even though it only utilizes your body's weight. But other calistening exercises do, in fact, it listed high enough of a demand to hit those large muscle fibers. Take a pull up for example, where on average, people can hardly even do 5, the movement demands all fiber types to far and eventually exhaust, thus promoting muscle growth. Pushups are another good example of a calistening exercise that can enlist muscle growth, especially for beginners that struggle to do even 10. But eventually you will run into the problem of not having enough resistance. As tough as it may be to get your first 10 pushups, eventually 10 would be just an easy warm-up. When you start hitting 20, 25, or 30 pushups easily, then we run into the same problem as we saw with jogging. Of course, you can definitely modify the pushup to make it tougher, such as elevating your feet on a platform, but ultimately you're not changing the amount of demand on the muscle groups involved in a standard pushup, instead you begin shifting the muscles involved in the movement. The feet elevated pushups, you're anterior shoulders begin taking the run of the resistance instead of your chest. So you want to build your chest, you won't have enough resistance, and you might be thinking, why not just add some weight on your back? While at that point, it's no longer just body weight, thus no longer calistening. The next natural progression is using weights. As great as calistening can be, there will be a point where certain muscle groups, especially the strong muscle groups such as your chest, legs, and hips, will eventually need greater resistance. The muscles in calistening require you using multiple muscle groups to perform an exercise, which isn't a bad thing at all in terms of natural and functional development, but it does make it tough to isolate certain muscles. Now that's not to say that calistening cannot build an aesthetically appealing body. After all, you have guys looking like this, from performing just body weight exercises, but when you compare them to this, there's a clear difference in muscle growth between the two regiments. Heck, even Olympic gymnasts have to use weights to push their maximum potential. This is not to say that calistening has no place in anyone's exercise program, you just have to understand its uses. The great thing about calistening is that it's absolutely free. All you have to have is to ground you walk on any park with bars. The only time you have to spend money is from buying things like suspension systems or gymnastics rings. For beginners, body weight exercises will provide all the necessary compound movements that are usually found in a beginner program, and doesn't require you to motivate yourself to go to the gym. So if you do calistnings and you like your results, stick with it. If you feel like you're starting to hit a wall, then it's time to move up to weights.
